# Team Workflow (Forks + Upstream + Draft PRs)

Upstream repository: `Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer`  
Default branch: `main`  
Merge strategy: **Squash merge**  
Review requirement: **1 approval**  
PRs should start as: **Draft**

---

## 1) Roles and definitions

- **Upstream**: `Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer` (shared team repo)
- **Fork**: each member’s GitHub copy of the upstream repo
- **origin**: your fork remote (what you push to)
- **upstream**: the team repo remote (what you pull from)

Rule: **Nobody pushes to `upstream/main` directly.** Everything goes through PRs.

---

## 2) One-time setup (each teammate)

### Fork on GitHub
Fork `Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer` into your own account.

### Clone your fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AcousticTracer.git
cd AcousticTracer
```

### Add upstream remote
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer.git
git remote -v
```

You should see:
- `origin` → your fork
- `upstream` → Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer

---

## 3) Starting work (always sync first)

Before creating a new branch, sync your `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## 4) Create a branch (never work on `main`)

Branch naming:
- `feature/<short-description>`
- `fix/<short-description>`
- `docs/<short-description>`

Create:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
```

Commit early and often:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Short, clear message"
```

Push your branch to your fork:
```bash
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
```

---

## 5) Open a PR (Draft first)

Open a PR **from your fork branch → `Acoustic-Resonance/AcousticTracer:main`**.

### Draft PR rule
Open the PR as **Draft** until:
- you’ve built the LaTeX successfully (if applicable)
- you’ve done a self-review
- the PR description is complete

When ready:
- click **Ready for review**
- request **1 reviewer**
- address feedback by pushing more commits to the same branch

---

## 6) Merge policy (Squash)
After 1 approval (and any required checks), merge using:

- **Squash and merge**

This keeps `main` history clean (one commit per PR).

---

## 7) After merge (everyone syncs)

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Then delete branches:
```bash
git branch -d feature/<short-description>
git push origin --delete feature/<short-description>
```

---

## 8) Repo conventions (for this project)

### Project structure 
- `docs/` for LaTeX and other markdown sources 
- `src/` for C / Python later
- `frontend/` for React later

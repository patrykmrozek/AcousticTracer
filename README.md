# AcousticTracer

Our project 'Acoustic Tracer' is a three-dimensional, acoustic visualiser that allows users to visualise sound travelling throughout a modelled environment as a heat map. At the core it is a C library, where the user can read in a `.glb` file (3D Model File), insert one or more speakers, specify simulation settings, and receive back a heat map of how the sound travelled through the environment over time. Our final project extends it into a web-based application that renders this heat map and makes the configuration of the scene and simulation more user-friendly, while also allowing more technical users to achieve their desired configuration.

Some demonstrations of it's functionality:
